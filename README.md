# BattleLeap

A tactical **2D platformer shooter** for 2-4 players.
This project was created as a hobby in the **Godot Engine**. It represents a personal project I worked on for fun, which I also share here alongside my other work.

## üß© About the Game
BattleLeap is a local multiplayer platform shooter where up to 4 players fight each other to be the last one standing.
Players can move, jump, crouch, and shoot, while avoiding hazards like explosive barrels and fire. Breakable crates may drop healing items to keep the battle going.
The focus is on positioning, timing, and survival rather than speed.
